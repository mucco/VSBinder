## Scenes

There are two main types of scene: challenge scenes, which feature a difficulty the party must overcome, and "pacing" scenes, which do not. It is desirable to have a mix of both in a game, to ensure the rhythm of the game is appropriate to the situation.

- Sample Challenge scenes
  - Combat: a foe is stopping progress, and will likely have to be overcome by force
  - Exploration: the environment has to be navigated, but its features are hindering progress
  - Investigation: a certain thing needs to be found or discovered
  - Social: someone needs to be convinced of something

- Sample Pacing scenes
  - Exposition: something external in the world happens
  - Progress: the party achieves something and consequences unfold
  - Montage: the party sets out to do a lengthy but unchallenging activity
  - Rest: the characters are at leisure to interact with each other or the world without plot consequences
  - Exploration: the party interacts with the environment in search of something
